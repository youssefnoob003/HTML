          Tomorrow you'll begin the process of looking for survivors. In Oskar Schindler's case, there are eleven
          hundred of them. He is now looking at himself. This is history. This is six hundred years of shame. More than
          six hundred years of people who were put down. The shame is over." --1993 film "Schindler's List"</p>
