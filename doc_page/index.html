      <p>
        Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is used for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>web development (server-side),</li>
        <li>software development,</li>
        <li>mathematics,</li>
        <li>system scripting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        What can Python do?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
        <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
        <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
        <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
        <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Why Python?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
        <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
        <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
        <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
        <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>

        Prerequisites
      </header>
      <p>
        To learn Python, you need to have a basic understanding of the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Basic Computer Skills - Anyone starting to learn computer programming needs basic computer skills. Python is a cross-platform language, so it makes no difference whether you use a macOS, Windows, or even Linux.
        </li>
        <li>
          Probability & Statistics - If you're truly a novice in computer science or computer programming, a strong math foundation can help. Many students who learn Python go on to data science or software engineering careers, and probability and statistics play a crucial role in these fields.
        </li>
        <li>
          Front End Vs. Back End - A Python beginner may also want to learn the language to prepare for a role as a Python Developer, Back End Developer, or Full Stack Developer. Front end, or user-side, development often relies on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, whereas Python often finds a home on the back end or server side.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Good Text Editor - You will need a good text editor to write Python programs. There are many text editors available, such as Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, or Notepad++. However, you can use any text editor that you are comfortable with.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you think web development sounds like your ideal career track, consider a course like Noble Desktop's <a href="https://www.nobledesktop.com/certificates/python-developer" target="_blank">Python Developer Certificate.</a> Students who want to learn Python as part of a broader data science curriculum can get their training as part of a Data Science Certificate program.

        Your first code
      </header>
      <p>
        Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:
      </p>
      <code>
C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py 
      </code>
      <p>
        Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        helloworld.py
      </p>
      <code>
print("Hello, World!")
      </code>
      <p>
        Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:
      </p>
      <code>
C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py
      </code>
      <p>
        The output should read:
      </p>
      <code>
Hello, World!
      </code>
      <p>
        Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.

        Variables
      </header>
      <p>
        Variables are containers for storing data values.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
      <code>
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
      </code>
      <p>
        Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
      <code>
x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
      </code>
      <p>
        String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
        <code>
x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'
      </code>
      <p>
        Variable names are case-sensitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
      <code>
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
      </code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="if..else_statements">
      <header>
        if..else statements
      </header>
      <p>
        Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
      </p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Equals: <code class="code-small">a == b</code></li>
        <li>Not Equals: <code class="code-small">a != b</code></li>
        <li>Less than: <code class="code-small">a < b</code></li>
        <li>Less than or equal to: <code class="code-small">a <= b</code></li>
        <li>Greater than: <code class="code-small">a > b</code></li>
        <li>Greater than or equal to: <code class="code-small">a >= b</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
      </p>
      <p>
        An "if statement" is written by using the <code class="code-small">if</code> keyword.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
      <code>
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
      </code>
      <p>
        In this example we use two variables, <code class="code-small">a</code> and <code class="code-small">b</code>, which are used as part of the <code class="code-small">if</code> statement to test whether <code class="code-small">b</code> is greater than <code class="code-small">a</code>. As <code class="code-small">a</code> is 33, and <code class="code-small">b</code> is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".
      </p>
      <p>
        The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
      <code>
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
      </code>
      <p>
        In this example <code class="code-small">a</code> is equal to <code class="code-small">b</code>, so the first condition is not true, but the <code class="code-small">elif</code> condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b are equal".
      </p>
      <p>
        The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
      <code>
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")
      </code>
      <p>
        In this example <code class="code-small">a</code> is greater than <code class="code-small">b</code>, so the first condition is not true, also the <code class="code-small">elif</code> condition is not true, so we go to the else condition and print to screen that "a is greater than b".
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also have an <code class="code-small">else</code> without the <code class="code-small">elif</code>:
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
      <code>
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not greater than a")
      </code>
      <p>
        In this example <code class="code-small">a</code> is greater than <code class="code-small">b</code>, so the first condition is not true, also the <code class="code-small">elif</code> condition is not true, so we go to the else condition and print to screen that "b is not greater than a".
      </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="for_loops">
      <header>
        for loops
      </header>
      <p>
        A <code class="code-small">for</code> loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
      </p>
      <p>
        This is less like the <code class="code-small">for</code> keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the <code class="code-small">for</code> loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
      <code>
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
      </code>
      <p>
        The <code class="code-small">for</code> loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The break Statement
      </p>
      <p>
        With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
      <code>
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break
      </code>
      <p>
        The continue Statement
      </p>
      <p>
        With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next:
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
      <code>
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x)
      </code>

    <section class="main-section" id="while_loops">
      <header>
        while loops
      </header>
      <p>
        With the <code class="code-small">while</code> loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
      <code>
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
      </code>
      <p>
        The <code class="code-small">break</code> Statement
      </p>
      <p>
        With the <code class="code-small">break</code> statement we can stop the loop even if the <code class="code-small">while</code> condition is true:
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
      <code>
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1
      </code>
      <p>
        The <code class="code-small">continue</code> Statement
      </p>
      <p>
        With the <code class="code-small">continue</code> statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>

        functions
      </header>
      <p>
        A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
      </p>
      <p>
        A function can return data as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating a Function
      </p>
      <p>
        In Python a function is defined using the <code class="code-small">def</code> keyword:
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
      <code>
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")
      </code>
      <p>
        Calling a Function
      </p>
      <p>
        To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
      <code>
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")

my_function()
      </code>
      <p>
        Parameters
      </p>
      <p>
        Information can be passed to functions as parameter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parameters are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following example has a function with one parameter (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:
      </p>
      <p>
        Example
      </p>
      <code>
def my_function(fname):
  print(fname + " Refsnes")

my_function("Emil")
my_function("Tobias")
my_function("Linus")
      </code>
      <p>
        A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.
      </p>
